# キヌレニンが意味するもの
I created disease dictionary that were obtained from the web mainly from Mayo clinic homepage, and pubmed 800-900 articles (searching word is 'kynurenine') were obtained from NCBI, <br>
and frequency of tokens were counted. <br>

<h3>Why kynurenine?<br></h3>
<h4>It might be realated to tryptophan metabolism.</h4>

Tryptophan is related to many pathways, and one of those is serotonin synthesis pathway.<br>
Serotonin is strongly related to the nerve systems.<br>
So I think this result is not so incorrect

About this result, when in couting the tokens of diseases words, I removed manually some of too famous word such as "cancer" (the single word) because of inassignments of cancer type, and incomplete words because of unsuitableness for systematical matching.<br>
